# Image-Processing-Project-using-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset
This project aims to compare the performance of K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Network using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The fashion MNIST dataset has been chosen because it is a newer dataset (first published in 2017) with higher difficulty compared to the MNIST dataset (published in 1998).
