# Image-Processing-Project-using-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset
This project aims to compare the performance of K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Network using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The fashion MNIST dataset has been chosen because it is a newer dataset (first published in 2017) with higher difficulty compared to the MNIST dataset (published in 1998).

# To run the project #

##### Open the file named "Project code.ipynb" #####

The delivered jupyter notebook script "Project code" is an automated, parameterless demonstration script, no parameters need to be provided. No cells of the jupyter notebook are necessary to run during the demonstration. All results and corresponding confusion matrix have been displayed in the jupyter notebook script.
	
However, for testing the correctness of the displayed results some cells of the notebook can be tested. It will require lots of time to run all cells. Data preprocessing and CNN model training are very time consuming. SVM has been implemented with different kernels, only a specific kernel's result can be tested by deleting all other kernels from the kernels array (The array is indicated in the jupyter notebook script under the Support Vector Machine heading).
